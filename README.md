## Challenges Faced

During the development of the e-commerce application, a significant challenge arose with implementing the search functionality. While the search filter logic was correctly filtering the data (as evidenced by console logs showing proper filtering of products), the results weren't being displayed in the user interface. The main issue was in the state management and component rendering cycle - although the data was being filtered correctly, the UI wasn't updating to reflect these changes. The solution involved restructuring the state management in the useProducts hook by separating the original products state from the filtered products state, and ensuring proper propagation of state updates to trigger re-renders of the components. This experience highlighted the importance of proper state management in React applications and the need for clear data flow patterns. Although the implementation seemed straightforward initially, debugging and fixing this issue required a systematic approach to identify where the state updates weren't properly triggering UI changes.
